# Canara Bank Hackathon Project

> A BBA system designed for more secure and private banking experience

## Work Done till now and why:

1. We used the HuMIDb dataset as the base dataset for testing our dakota model.
2. The initial task was data preprocessing and cleaning and in turn organising.
3. The JSONs and CSVs were fixed from a lot of structural problems for faster processing.
> 4. Current task: merging the CSVs now into a unified CSV
